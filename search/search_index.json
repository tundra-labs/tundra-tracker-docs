The latest firmware will be distributed via SteamVR. Where is the best placement for the dongle? The dongle is sensitive to interference, so ideally place it \u201cin view\u201d of your Trackers (Not at the back of your computer), unobstructed by anything else. We recommend using the USB 2.0 extension cable that comes with the dongle to put it at the edge of your desk - or something to that effect. How many Trackers and Controllers can be paired at the same time? 3 devices can be paired with SW3, 5 devices can be paired with SW5 and 7 devices can be paired with SW7. Can I place my SW dongle inside the Frunk of Valve Index? The SW3 yes, but we recommend against placing the SW5 and SW7 inside the frunk as that may cause overheating. Where shall I contact if my Dongle is dead or broken? First we recommend checking out the forum and going through our \"troubleshooting guide\" (to be added).

As Tundra Trackers are SteamVR devices, you can use mixed trackers. How long does it take to charge Tundra Tracker? Chart/figures to be added. How long does a Tundra Tracker\u2019s battery last if it\u2019s fully charged? At least 9 hours on average. Does the temperature of Tundra Tracker get high after using it for hours? No, we don\u2019t see any temperature increase on the surface of its base plate. Please do not cover the top of Tundra Tracker to keep tracking accuracy. Where can I download the 3D model of Tundra Tracker? Here Can I use a magnetic charging cable for Tundra Tracker? Yes. Make sure to use a USB type C connector. Can I use a silicone skin for Tundra Tracker? No, we do not recommend using a silicon skin as it will cover chips for tracking inside Tundra Tracker. Where should I get in touch if my tracker is dead or broken? First we recommend checking out the forum and going through our \"troubleshooting guide\" (to be added).
